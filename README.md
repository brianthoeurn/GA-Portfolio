# Your User stories â€“ who are your users, what do they want and why?
  - As a recruiter I want to be able to see if this person is the right fit for our team.
  - All their work should be easily accessible, their coding is clean and easy to read.
  - As the creator I should always look for a way to improve, what can I do to make this better and how can I accomplish that?
  
# Descriptions of major hurdles you had to overcome!
  - Changed my welcome page from something that loads automatically to a user interaction to where a user has to click the welcome screen
  - My Greetings on top of my page took some thinking, initially i had it popped instantly but I had some resources showing me how to make it fade in, making it look alot cleaner
  
# Unsolved problems
  - Would like to move my open navigation menu button so its accessible from where ever the user is currently on page.
  - Input actual projects where the placeholder images are, wanted to temporarily add tamagatchi/tic-tac-toe that we worked on but had trouble doing so
  - Still have problems with CSS and making sure everything fits neatly on a page whether they are on desktop/mobile/tablet
  - There are times where I feel like I am repeating my code or thinking that there are ways to shorten it.
